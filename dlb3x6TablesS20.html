The course shows how to implement algorithms and data structures to solve problems while utilizing paradigms offered by the programming languages such as procedural, object-oriented, protocol-oriented, functional, and declarative. Language support for strong and weak typing and type safety are covered along with support for optional values. Provides experience in developing algorithms and determining their efficiency, designing application architecture, and developing applications. Building and using libraries/application programming interfaces is covered. Git and GitHub are used for code versioning and collaboration. Integrated development environments (IDEs) are used for managing, building, debugging, and testing applications.</td>

Through hands-on experience with capturing technology, audio recording devices, and the software and hardware components needed to manipulate the recordings, students will process big-data files to create meaningful manipulations in assembly, engineering, and colorization. Students will utilize a spectrum of camera equipment, recording devices and facilities to achieve an understanding of audio/video capture, project planning and implementation, hardware assessment, optimization practices through hardware acceleration, and video processing. This course also focuses on basic editing theory and industry trends. This is done through in-class demonstrations, online modules, and supplementary material hosted on online.</td>
